# javaShoppingCart
COP4331- Final project   


This project was my final for my Object-Oriented Design and programming course
I had to create a java Shopping Cart, the minimum requirements were:


  A customer logs in with a user name and password and a window (frame) opens where he can browse
  through a list of available products that includes the product name, price, and available quantity.
  From this window the customer can select products and add them to the shopping cart or they can click on a product and get the full
  product description, pricing and availability (quantity available) in a pop-up window. The
  customer can add the product to the shopping cart (quantity), depending on availability.
  The shopping cart total amount is kept current on the main product browse window.


  The customer can proceed to checkout at any time. On the checkout window, the shopping
  cart can be updated by changing the item count for each product in the cart. At checkout
  the customer verifies the shopping cart content and pays for the goods by
  supplying the credit card. The application does not arrange for shipping. 

  When the seller logs in, a window opens where the current state of the inventory is shown.
  The seller can update the inventory by adding products - specifying product name, invoice price,
  sell price and by updating the available quantity.

  The internal product representation includes ID, type, quantity, invoice price, and
  selling price. The application must keep track of all costs, revenues and profits.
  The seller can access this information from the application UI.



  FYI:
  Profit = Revenues - Costs,
  Revenues = Sum of sell price for all sold items
  Costs = Sum of invoice price for all items brought in the inventory (bought)
